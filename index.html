            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey there! Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio! I spent a lot of time creating it, so I truly appreciate it!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Virginia where I spent the first 29 years of my life! Ready for a change and eager for more out of life, I decided to move to Charlotte, NC! I live here now with my girlfriend, our two dogs, and our cat!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                I've had a few jobs that have led me to where I am now. I started working retail at a video game store. After several years of that, I moved to northern Virginia and began working in hospitality sales. A few years later, I made the move to Charlotte where I worked at a restaurant for several months before accepting a digital marketing position!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the customer service and retention side of the digital marketing world is what I was exposed to far more than the industry itself. Feeling discouraged by that path, I decided to look inward and ask myself what I really felt like I wanted to do. That's how I wound up here!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                I've always loved technology and considered myself a geek. Several of my good friends are in the software engineering industry. I believe this path is going to allow me to achieve all of my professional and personal goals I have made for myself!
